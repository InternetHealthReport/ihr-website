The world map shows the location of disconnected Atlas probes and the below graphs show ping results from these probes. These ping measurements provide us with an internal view of the outage. Here we found that pings toward Google DNS and Atlas controller failed from around 00:45 until 01:35. Pings to the K-root server are, however, carried out as usual. This means that this network could still reach a K-root instance during the outage (probably the one located in Teheran).<br><br>The table reports a deviation score, 11 in this case, and the number of disconnected Atlas probes. Larger deviation values represent stronger evidence of the network disconnection. To avoid too many false positives, only higher values are reported (this threshold is different for the global and network reports). We also only monitor networks and countries that have at least five Atlas probes."
