It aims to provide network operators, policymakers, and other stakeholders, with a better understanding of the Internet's infrastructure and its evolution. Network data is obtained from public large-scale measurement platform, such as RIPE Atlas, RIS, and Routeviews. This data is analyzed with a set of tools pinpointing delay changes, forwarding anomalies, network disconnections and routing changes.  In a general effort towards transparency and reusability, the Internet Health Report data and analysis tools are made publicly available.",

That means the most common transit networks used to reach AS2497. The value (a.k.a AS hegemony) ranges between 0 and 1. This is an estimate of the ratio of AS paths towards AS2497 that go through a certain AS transit. A value close to 1 means that the reachability of the monitored AS is strongly dependant on that transit AS. In the above example, the plot shows a few weak dependencies to Telia (AS1299), NTT America (AS2914), Level(3) (AS3356), and GTT (AS3257). On that day we estimate around 16% of the paths towards IIJ transit through Telia, 9% through NTT, and 2% through Level(3).</p> <p>Stub ASes usually have much higher values, for example the values go up to 1 for  ASes with a single upstream provider (meaning that all the paths cross the upstream provider). You can click on the graph to display dependencies details at a particular timestamp and a graphical representation of BGP changes around that time (<a href='https://labs.ripe.net/Members/vastur/bgplay-v2-integrated-in-ripestat' target='_blank'>using BGPlay</a>).</p> <p><b>The bottom plot</b> shows the number of networks that depend on AS2497.
