It aims to provide network operators, policymakers, and other stakeholders, with a better understanding of the Internet's infrastructure and its evolution. Network data is obtained from public large-scale measurement platforms, such as RIPE Atlas, RIS, and Route Views. This data is analyzed with a set of tools pinpointing delay changes, forwarding anomalies, network disconnections and routing changes.  In a general effort towards transparency and reusability, the Internet Health Report data and analysis tools are made publicly available.",

The best way to ensure that your network is monitored is to host an anchor (delay changes, forwarding anomalies) and at least ten probes (network disconnection). <br><br>For <b>routing changes</b>, we use BGP data to monitor the Internet routing infrastructure.

The value (a.k.a AS Hegemony) ranges between 0 and 1. This is an estimate of the ratio of AS paths towards AS2497 that go through a certain AS transit. A value close to 1 means that the reachability of the monitored AS is strongly dependant on that transit AS. In the above example, the plot shows a few weak dependencies to Telia (AS1299), NTT America (AS2914), Level(3) (AS3356), and GTT (AS3257). On that day we estimate around 16% of the paths towards IIJ transit through Telia, 9% through NTT, and 2% through Level(3).</p> <p>Stub ASes usually have much higher values, for example the values go up to 1 for  ASes with a single upstream provider (meaning that all the paths cross the upstream provider). You can click on the graph to display dependency details at a particular timestamp and a graphical representation of BGP changes around that time (<a href='https://labs.ripe.net/Members/vastur/bgplay-v2-integrated-in-ripestat' target='_blank'>using BGPlay</a>).</p> <p><b>The bottom plot</b> shows the number of networks that depend on AS2497.

The top plot (blue line) represents the overall delay changes we observe for AS7922's links. This value is normally close to 0, but features higher values when we observe significant delay changes for IP addresses in that AS. In this example we see that AS7922 exhibits increased delays around midnight on March 4th. By clicking on the peak at 1:30am we obtain the list of IP addresses that are detected by our system (bottom table) and the end-to-end delays for traceroute monitoring reported IP addresses. Here we see that end-to-end delays of traceroutes crossing the first reported links have increased by 60 ~ 90 ms. The red vertical dashed lines also show that packets are dropped at that time."

Intuitively, this graph represents the presence and absence of IP addresses for AS174 in the monitored traceroutes. If the number of observed IP addresses for AS174 is constant then the forwarding anomaly level is close to 0. If we observe more IP addresses than usual then the forwarding anomaly level takes higher positive values. On the other hand if we observe fewer IP addresses than usual, the forwarding anomaly level takes lower negative values. In this example, IP addresses from AS174 are appearing more than usual due to an internal routing anomaly.
