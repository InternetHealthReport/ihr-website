# Quick guide
This guide's purpose is to help maintainers to get used to with the technologies used as quick as possible .

## Prerequisites
This guide cannot cover all missing knowledge so here's a list to basic stuff:
* **es6 javascript**: https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features
* **vuejs**: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/
* **CSS stylus**: http://stylus-lang.com/

## Plugins
### vue-fragment
permit to have multiple elements as root of a template
https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-fragments

## Quasar UI
You can take a look here https://quasar.dev/introduction-to-quasar, but this
guide summarizes some simple stuff for maintenance.

### Component configuration

*src/quasar.js* contains all loaded components. If some used components are missing you can probably see some weird looking stuff.
check that the corresponding component is loaded and it's directive are loaded on it's quasar page (e.g. https://quasar.dev/vue-components/ajax-bar, installation section)

### Layout
Whenever possible the Flex Grid layout it's utilized. Briefly it consists of
rows and columns (cols) elements. The row (class="row") is divided in 12 cols and the default behavior
is to wrap (moving to below row) cols (class="col") that cannot fit in those 12.
A col can span upto multiple cols (col-\[n\]) and can be defined differently for different
viewport (col-\[vp\]-\[n\]).
The full reference is in the quasar website https://quasar.dev/layout/grid/introduction-to-flexbox.

## Translations
if a view or a component has only unique elements to translate you can do
it directly into is file
You can use https://www.codeandweb.com/babeledit (one time payment)

## Routes
The structure of the urls contain the locale in use (*/:locale/...*)".
The simplest way to take this in account in routes is [named routes](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/named-routes.html).
briefly:
* name all routes in *router.js* file, and prepend routerBase to each route
* when routing (using either \<router-link\> or router.update()) use the name. This will prevent the change of the parameters
